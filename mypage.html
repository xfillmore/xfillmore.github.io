        <p>
            Hi there. I am majoring in Creative Technology and Design and minoring in Computer Science.
            Before taking CSCI 1320 for the aerospace curriculum, I was under the impression that I would
            dislike coding because my dad is a software engineer and his job seems terribly boring. It still does.
            However, I've discovered that his job is just one part of computer science, and there's a lot about
            CS that's actually interesting. I'm especially into the web development side of things ever since my
            internship where I built the foundation for an internal company site with Django.
            Some interesting things about me? I suppose some of my hobbies include
            collecting succulents, gardening, cooking, and reading science fiction and fantasy novels. My favorite
            music genre is definitely alternative rock, with artists ranging from Imagine Dragons to New Politics to
            Of Monsters and Men. And finally, one thing you should know about me is that I do not frequent social media.
            I once had SnapChat for like five minutes, and I think my account is still floating around out there. I used to have
            Instagram before they did the major revamp, but no longer have accounts there. I do have a Facebook account,
            which only frustrates my mother when she tries to send me content but I don't see it until seven plus months later (true story,
            on more than one occassion). In other words, the only reason I keep my Facebook account is because my mother
            wants to keep tagging me in pictures. Otherwise, I've never had a Twitter, Reddit, Vine, etc etc account.
